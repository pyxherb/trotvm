# Freestanding mode in XY

XY provides two dinstinct execution mode: hosted and freestanding.

Freestanding means that the execution is in an environment without an operating
system (or any comparable library or hypervisor).

XY provides the freestanding mode for system-level programming (e.g. for codes
that execute in the kernel mode).
